- Comprehensive unit tests with Vitest and Testing Library

---

## Tech Stack
- **React** (TypeScript, Vite)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **React Query** (data fetching/caching)
- **Orval** (OpenAPI codegen)
- **Axios** (API requests)
- **Vitest** + **Testing Library** (unit/component testing)
- **nginx** (production web server)
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (multi-service orchestration)

---

## Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the dev server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   - The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - The dev server proxies `/api` requests to the backend (see `vite.config.ts`)

3. **Run tests:**
   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Generate API client from OpenAPI spec:**
   ```sh
   npm run generate:api
   ```
   - The OpenAPI spec should be available at `http://localhost:3001/api/` (or as configured)

---

## Docker & Production

### **Build and Run with Docker Compose**

1. **Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` includes:**
   - `frontend` (this app)
   - `backend` (API service)
   - `postgres` (database)

2. **Build and start all services:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - The backend and database are networked for seamless API access

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - The frontend uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to communicate with the backend (set to `http://backend:3000` in Docker Compose)

### **Build and Run the Frontend Independently with Docker**

You can also build and run the frontend app as a standalone Docker container:

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t f1-fe .
   ```
2. **Run the container:**
-e VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 5173:80 \
     --name f1-fe f1-fe
   ```
   - Replace `http://localhost:3001` with your backend API URL as needed.
   - The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Accessibility & Testing
- Semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation
- Responsive with Tailwind
- Unit/component tests: `npm run test`
- Test coverage for all major UI and data-fetching logic

---

## API Integration
- API client is auto-generated from the backend OpenAPI spec using Orval
- To update the client, run `npm run generate:api` after updating the backend spec
- All API requests are routed through a custom Axios instance, using the correct base URL for each environment
